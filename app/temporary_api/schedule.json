In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click.

In this session we'll look at how to think holistically about performance, and how to prioritize optimization work that your users will notice and appreciate.",

      "description": "No omnipresent tool in history has ever had as much computing power or as many sensors as the modern smartphone. Yet, we’re still struggling to harness and contextualize this opportunity into more intuitive interactions: why doesn’t my transit app automatically detect my current stop? Why doesn’t my fitness app understand I was on a stationary bike?\n\nJoin us to hear how we’re beginning to use beacons to enable smarter interactions based on precise context: expanding the conversation from inferring context to creating context, and from mapping the world to marking it up. This talk introduces Google’s beacon platform, and Eddystone, a new open BLE beacon format, designed to make beacon development and deployment easier for everyone.",

Virtual reality introduces a new set of physiological and ergonomic considerations to your design work. Additionally, as a new medium users may not have established a familiarity with interacting with virtual reality applications yet. And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the user’s focus and attention. We’ll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well. We'll also discuss best practices for rapid prototyping in virtual reality, and what the Google VR design team has learned from crafting virtual reality applications.",

This talk will show you how to set this up in your own apps, and will demo several scenarios with popular apps that “just work” out of the box after a restore.

Today, most IoT devices require installing a dedicated app, which simply doesn't scale when you want to interact with a multitude of smart “things” around you every day.\n\nThe web is a natural fit, offering interaction on demand without the friction and overhead of installation. This talk introduces the Physical Web, a technology that lets you walk up and use anything with just a tap.",

As we remove abstract barriers, such as what functionality resides on what device, our users can focus more on what they're doing and less on how to start doing it.\n\nJoin this session for an in-depth look at the platform components involved in building a single user experience across their phone, watch, TV, and car.

Project Loon balloons float in the stratosphere, twice as high as airplanes and most weather events, forming a mesh network in the sky. Users can connect to the internet from the balloon network through their handheld devices as the balloons fly overhead.\n\nThis talk will present the vision, the history, and the technology behind Project Loon.",
