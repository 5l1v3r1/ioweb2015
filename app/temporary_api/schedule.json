And most importantly, can Brazil be defeated at soccer on their own turf? In this talk, we'll go through the process of data extraction, modelling and prediction as well as generating a live dashboard to visualize the results. We’ll demonstrate how you can use Google Cloud and Open Source technologies to make predictions about the biggest soccer matches in the world. You’ll see how to use Google BigQuery for data analytics and Monte Carlo simulations, as well as how to create machine learning models in R and pandas. We predict that after this talk you’ll have the necessary tools to cast your own eye on the future.",

However, sharing state from highscore lists to to-do lists between devices in a way that works well with spotty network connections is hard, error prone and expensive.   Wouldn’t it be great if Google took care of all that, while providing an easy path to expand as your app grows and matures?   \n\nIn this session, we will show you how to build mobile apps which use new Google technology to simplify data storage, online/offline behavior and synchronization across multiple devices. You’ll have full access to the data you store in the Google Cloud platform with app development features and the rich set of data analytics tools to get more use out of your data.   You’ll see how Android Studio tooling makes this straightforward, and allows you to bring the full power of Google Cloud Platform to your app as your needs grow. Come away equipped with new tools and skills to make your app better than ever, without writing hundreds of lines of code.",

From expanding access to social services for low-income residents to improving access to education, social entrepreneurs are increasingly using technology to create new solutions to old problems. Google’s Impact Challenges travel the world asking social entrepreneurs to tell us their ideas for using technology to make their local community a better place. Winners receive funding and Google support to make their ideas a reality. This is a unique opportunity to hear from three Bay Area winners, One Degree, Beyond 12 and Hack the Hood, understand their inspiration for changing the world, and learn about how you as a developer can do transformative things with technology in your local community.",

We all strive to create the perfect engaging design that users will like—ultimately love—and want to use over and over and never abandon. Sounds like a love story? It sure is. Why? This is because our users actually do fall in love with great applications as a result of subconscious mating patterns when they interact with the applications we distribute. This is what makes these application so easy to distribute among users. So, if you want to design an app which will be easily distributed, you must understand the relationship between humans and apps. In this presentation, you will be introduced to a framework for creating applications that are both attractive and appealing and therefore, distributable. You will learn some tips on how to design apps that will instantly catch the user’s attention—call it love at first sight, be fun to use and be less prone to be abandoned. Now, don’t we all want to create such applications?",

In his latest book, How To Create A Mind, he takes this exploration to the next step: reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, then applying that knowledge to create intelligent machines. In the near term, Ray's project at Google is developing artificial intelligence based on biologically inspired models of the neocortex to enhance functions such as search, answering questions, interacting with the user, and language translation. The goal is to understand natural language to communicate with the user as well as to understand the meaning of web documents and books. In the long term, Ray believes it is only by extending our minds with our intelligent technology that we can overcome humanity’s grand challenges.",

In 2006, Google developed Linux container technology that enabled world leading fleet utilization, efficiency and scale.  More recently, these same core technologies formed the foundation of Docker, the popular, new open source container environment.  \n\nJoin us in this session and see how containers are re-making the cloud computing landscape. Learn how Google Cloud Platform is making itself the best place in the world to run container images.  Come see how containers and Google Cloud Platform make it easier to build, run and maintain distributed systems, by building on the same core container technologies that power all of Google.  Get a first look at Kubernetes, the new open source container cluster management implementation that turns these concepts into reality. Come learn how containers and Google Cloud Platform make the technology and application architectures that power Google available to all developers across the world. ",

The second part of this talk will dive into some of the internals of how various capabilities of material design on Android work; it will provide an interesting look under the covers to see how platform functionality evolves and how to achieve high-performance, rich effects in constrained situations.",

We also recently launched the source code to End-To-End, an encryption extension for Chrome, where we're explicitly calling for community feedback. And then there's the Google Transparency Report, which includes information both from Safe Browsing and from our Safer Email effort to understand how much encrypted email we send and receive. Please join us for a session about how Google's security team approaches its work, updates about End-To-End, Safe Browsing, and Safer Email, and how developers can tap into what we do.",

Deriving meaning from your data, at any scale, doesn't have to involve a tangle of clusters, configurations, and scripts that takes a team of specialized administrators to unravel. In fact, you can make it manageable and easy for all developers without losing insight in the process. We've created easy-to-use services so that you can run deep analytics on both streaming and historical data with as little effort as hosting an app on App Engine. \n\nHowever, sometimes, you need more control and configurability than managed services allow. That doesn't mean that you lose all the benefits of the Big Data tools that Google Cloud Platform has developed. You can easily combine managed services, where it makes sense, with Open Source tools like Hadoop and Spark. This session will dive into what you can use today to manage Big Data like Google itself does, “the Cloud way”, as well as how you can plan to scale as your data needs shift and mature.",

As those needs evolve, so too must our designs, practices, and philosophies.\n\nWe challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. The result is material design: a cross-platform design system grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.\n\nIn this session, design leads across Google discuss the key principles of material design, and set the stage for the later sessions focusing on interaction, motion and visual design.",

Eden founded GeekCon (geekcon.com) an un-conference in its 10th year that hosts makers, designers, artists, hackers and code monkeys, who spend 3 days teamed up to build anything from a laughing swing, solar sausage cooker, a tomato tank, “Superman” flight simulator, full body security access authenticator or large-scale kitesurfing simulator. The only requirement is that the projects need to be utterly useless.",

      "description": "App developers ask themselves excellent questions about their users: Do people need my app? Can people use my app? Why do people sign up and then not use my app? However, app developers answer their excellent questions in invalid and unreliable ways. It is shocking to see how much effort app developers put in writing elegantly structured, refactored code, with good unit test coverage in an agile environment, and yet, their apps fail miserably. \n\nThis talk will inspire developers to implement valid and reliable ways to answer their most burning questions. It’ll help them validate or invalidate their assumptions on their own—cheaply, and quickly, by using simple user research techniques with a main goal in mind: developing apps people need, want, and enjoy.",

Did you notice that spike in errors that you were serving at 3am? Because your users sure did. Luckily, we can help. We’ll show you how you can use Google Cloud Platform’s powerful logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities to quickly recognize when your applications aren’t behaving or performing well. It’s easy to set up, and it’s easy to use. We’ll demonstrate the integration of Stackdriver’s monitoring and alerting system with the Google Cloud Platform.

      "description": "Many websites still provide a poor experience on mobile, and so we wanted to develop an in-depth understanding of what differentiates a great and an inferior mobile experience. Our work has resulted in the development of a set of user experience principles for mobile website design. The principles illustrate how to create experiences that support conversion on mobile, whether that be for a purchase, a quote or a lead. The principles have been developed out of a study that Google User Experience Research conducted in partnership with AnswerLab - a user research consultancy. We studied 100 sites with diversity across size and vertical, and held 119 in-person, one-hour usability sessions with Android and iOS smartphone users. We instructed participants to perform key conversion-focused tasks, such as purchasing an item, booking a reservation, or researching plans or prices.  This presentation will illustrate key principles for designing a better mobile web. ",

They must give users all the benefits of technology they've come to expect, and more, while meeting them on their terms in a seamless and intrinsically human way.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the constellation of devices that make up not just wearable, but ubiquitous computing.  We'll tie them all together with common design and development practices as well as the Google Platform.  This is the key information that'll get you ready for being part of a sea change of technology that invariably puts the user first.",

Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions (or billions) of people; that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction; and that there is some real breakthrough or new approach that makes us believe these ideas could be brought to life. We meet in-person and online. \n\nWe’re running two special interactive Solve for X sessions at this year’s Google I/O.  After hearing short proposals from three tech pioneers, our audience will breakout into small-group brainstorming -- spending 2/3rds of the time generating ‘yes, and’ feedback (e.g. ideas for resources, funding, scaling), and 1/3rd of the time offering constructive critique (e.g. remaining questions, potential blind spots).  And then we gather to report back. \n\nJoin us! \n\n< Solve for X is an open platform powered by Google [x] and many partners and friends >",

      "description": "Uncovering user needs is one of the most challenging aspects of product development. Oh-so-many organizations develop beautiful products and services nobody needs. The Experience Sampling Method is a simple research technique for uncovering user needs. In a typical Experience Sampling method, research participants are interrupted several times a day to note their experience in real time. In this talk, Tomer Sharon will demonstrate the method, describe how it has been applied at Google Search, and provide a short, practical how-to guide.",

Through 2013 and 2014 we worked to bring these together under a single design and common brand, with a unified experience across multiple screens and devices.\n\nIn this session we’ll look at the Play design to see how it scales along two key vectors: consistency across tasks such as exploring, purchasing and consuming digital content; and consistency across a broad spectrum of screens, from phones to tablets to the web on 30\" desktop monitors. We’ll highlight the cards and clusters that organize content and look at the building blocks that let us implement a responsive design. Join us to hear why we set out on this journey and what we’ve learned along the way.",

Epic.\n\n120 countries, 6,827 developers on line, 48,486 module developer kits downloaded. For the first developer’s conference. Project Ara asks how we bring the benefits of an open hardware ecosystem to 6B people. It’s physical. We want to do for hardware what open platforms have done for software… create a vibrant third-party developer ecosystem, lower the barrier to entry, increase the pace of innovation, and compress development timelines.  \n\nFrom imaging and authentication to a new creative canvas that powers mobile storytelling. Universities to large scale manufacturers. Your garage to zero g.  \n\nDiversity. Scale. Speed. Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group. ATAP.

Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions (or billions) of people; that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction; and that there is some real breakthrough or new approach that makes us believe these ideas could be brought to life. We meet in-person and online. \n\nWe’re running two special interactive Solve for X sessions at this year’s Google I/O.  After hearing short proposals from three tech pioneers, our audience will breakout into small-group brainstorming -- spending 2/3rds of the time generating ‘yes, and’ feedback (e.g. ideas for resources, funding, scaling), and 1/3rd of the time offering constructive critique (e.g. remaining questions, potential blind spots).  And then we gather to report back. \n\nJoin us! \n\n< Solve for X is an open platform powered by Google [x] and many partners and friends >",
